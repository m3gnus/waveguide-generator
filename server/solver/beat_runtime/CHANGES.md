# Review slices

All paths are relative to the WG repository root. Changes are additive; no
production caller adopts beat-engine, no pins change, and HBB state is untouched.

- **PR 2 — paths/assets:** `server/solver/beat_runtime/{__init__,paths,assets}.py`;
  `server/tests/beat_runtime/test_{paths,assets}.py`; this `CHANGES.md`.
  WG overrides select bases with `wg-beat-engine` appended. Asset discovery is
  lazy, uses beat-engine's public API, and reports missing package/wheel assets.
- **PR 3 — identity:** `server/solver/beat_runtime/identity.py`;
  `server/tests/beat_runtime/test_identity.py`.
  Hash named bytes recursively, including versioned manifests and selected
  project/sysimage; hash WG runtime and compiled policy separately. Unavailable
  required inputs raise; content identity has no absolute paths or stale cache.
- **PR 4 — threads:** `server/solver/beat_runtime/threads.py`;
  `server/solver/beat_threads.py`; `server/tests/beat_runtime/test_threads.py`.
  Resolve beat-engine AUTO to an integer once for future key/start/probe/warm-up use.
  Preserve the legacy HBB façade's non-Metal `"auto"` and Metal headroom.

Scope notes: positive explicit thread counts are strict (invalid values raise).
Directory symlinks in fingerprint trees are refused rather than silently omitted.
Host keys/start integration and private directory creation belong to later PRs;
the thread snapshot boundary is exercised with fakes here. No CUDA/ROCm changes
or device qualification are included.

# CAD operations

This is the contract for work that crosses between Waveguide Generator (WG) and a CAD
adapter such as the WGLink add-in for Fusion. It defines what an accepted operation is,
how a repeated or conflicting delivery is recognised, which attempt may record a
result, and what a recorded outcome means.

- The durable half is the `cad_operations` table in `cadlink.db`
  (`server/cadlink/store.py`, schema version 12).
- The executable half, meaning the kinds, shapes, digest and vocabulary, is
  `server/cadlink/operations.py`.

This page and that module must agree. Change them together.

**Status of this cut.** The store, the identity rules and the vocabulary below are in
place, and the solve-command outcome ledger already lives in the store. Per-command
delivery files, WG-produced Fusion markers and the adapter's reconciliation are later
steps that build on this contract. A later step adds a field to a request only under a
new digest version.

## Operation kinds

| Kind | Target: what it addresses | Inputs: immutable references | Needs a live CAD session |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `receive_snapshot` | `{}` | `{bundle_path, manifest_sha256}` | No |
| `prepare_and_solve` | `{}` | `{return_id, bundle_path, manifest_sha256}` | No |
| `request_return` | `{document_id, design_id, instance_id, expected_baseline}` | `{}` | Yes |
| `insert_link` | `{document_id, export_id}` | `{}` | Yes |
| `update_link` | `{document_id, design_id, instance_id, expected_baseline}` | `{export_id}` | Yes |

- **Fields.** Every field is a required string. All must be non-empty except
  `prepare_and_solve.return_id`, which a legacy single-slot solve marker may omit (the
  empty string).
- **No other field is accepted.** A transport field such as a session token or
  `requestedAt` is refused rather than silently hashed.
- **`expected_baseline`** is `{kind: "document_signature_hash", value}`: the
  document-wide signature the adapter reported when WG prepared the request.
- **Exact targets.** A request that addresses an existing instance (`request_return`,
  `update_link`) names that instance exactly. "The one matching link in this design" is
  not a target. That resolution survives only for legacy single-slot markers, whose rows
  are marked legacy.
- **Inserts.** `insert_link` has no instance yet. Its target is the destination
  document plus the export identity. A redelivered insert is recognised by that export
  identity already stamped on a link.
- **Solves and snapshots** address nothing in CAD, so their target is empty and
  everything they need is an input. Later inputs join under a new digest version: a
  snapshot id and a setup revision for a solve, and the import intent for a received
  snapshot once it has a producer.

## Identity

- **Operation ID.** The producer chooses it, and it stays stable across retries and
  redelivery. For a Fusion solve command it is the `commandId`. It is an opaque,
  non-empty string, and one ID space covers every kind.
- **Canonical request digest.** `sha256:` followed by the hex SHA-256 of the UTF-8 bytes
  of this document:

  ```json
  {"digestVersion": 1, "inputs": {}, "kind": "prepare_and_solve", "target": {}}
  ```

  - `target` and `inputs` are the normalised objects from the kinds table.
  - It is serialised with sorted keys, `,` and `:` as separators, no whitespace and no
    ASCII escaping.
  - Strings are hashed exactly as delivered, with no Unicode normalisation, trimming or
    case folding.
  - The key order a producer sent does not matter. An extra field is refused before
    hashing.
- **Digest version.** Stored with each row (`digest_version`). Only version 1 exists. A
  later canonicalisation gets a new number; a row keeps the version it was accepted
  under, and a delivery must be compared under that version.
- **The baseline is part of the identity.** A refreshed baseline makes a new operation
  with a new ID, never a rewrite of the old one. The signature is document-wide, so an
  edit anywhere in the returned scope conflicts. That is deliberately conservative.

## Delivery

A WG-bound command is handled in this order:

1. read the delivery;
2. validate its identity and payload;
3. persist the operation, or recover it;
4. acknowledge the delivery;
5. execute or resume.

A command is accepted only once its identity, digest, target and inputs are committed.

| Delivery | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Same operation ID, same digest | `recovered`: the existing operation, with whatever it has already recorded |
| Same operation ID, different digest or kind | `conflict`: the delivery is rejected. The stored operation is untouched, and its result is not the answer to this delivery. |
| Different operation ID, identical inputs | A separate, explicit request |

- **"Restartable"** means accepted work is recovered after the WG backend restarts. It
  does not mean work continues after the app and its backend have exited.
- **Transactions are short.** Each store call is one transaction. None is held open
  while Fusion recomputes or a mesher runs.

## Attempts and fencing

- **Generation.** Each row carries `attempt_generation`, which is 0 when the operation
  is accepted.
- **Claim** is a conditional update. It succeeds only when the caller names the current
  generation and the operation is `received`, `processing` or `needs_user_input`. It
  increments the generation and sets `processing`.
  - A second consumer holding the same generation loses.
  - Recovery takes over by claiming with the generation it read.
- **Recording an outcome** is also conditional on the generation, and it never touches a
  terminal row. A result from an obsolete attempt changes nothing and cannot revive a
  cancelled operation.
- **Job ids stick.** A job id, once attached, is never cleared.
- **This cut's solve commands.** The browser runs a solve command, and the outcome route
  records its result as the operation's current attempt, without claiming first.

## States

| State | Meaning | Terminal | Claimable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `received` | Accepted; no attempt has started | no | yes |
| `processing` | An attempt holds the current generation | no | yes, as a takeover |
| `needs_user_input` | Waiting for the user: unsaved work, a source review, no setup yet | no | yes |
| `accepted` | Done. For a solve, its job exists | yes | no |
| `rejected` | Can never proceed as requested | yes | no |
| `cancelled` | The user dismissed it | yes | no |
| `recovery_required` | Reserved. A CAD mutation began and its completion evidence is missing | no | no |

- **Transient is not an outcome.** "Cannot proceed now" never means "can never
  proceed". A transient failure is retried inside the attempt.
- **`recovery_required`** applies only to a CAD mutation (`insert_link`,
  `update_link`). It is never retried automatically, and it is not a rejection. It is
  settled only by reading the document (a reconciled `accepted`) or by the user
  (`cancelled`). The state is reserved now so the vocabulary does not change when the
  adapter starts to report it.

## Outcomes

`reason` holds a **reason code**, or nothing. A reason that is not a code is refused.

| Code | State | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseline_conflict` | `rejected` | The document no longer matches the expected baseline, and there is no evidence that this operation already applied |
| `target_not_exact` | `rejected` | The target does not resolve to exactly one instance |

Both are rejections because a refreshed baseline or target is a new operation.

`outcome_json` is an object with at most these fields:

- `message`: a human-readable explanation;
- `reconciled`: `true` when the outcome was recovered from the document rather than
  executed;
- `evidence`: with `reconciled: true`, the observed `{operation_id, export_id}`. Its
  `operation_id` must be this operation's.

A reconciled outcome is always `accepted`.

## Fusion-bound mutations

These rules bind every adapter that mutates a CAD document for WG.

1. **Reconciliation comes before the baseline check.**
   - On any delivery or redelivery, the adapter first reads the operation's evidence on
     the exact target: the operation ID stamped next to the export identity.
   - If that evidence shows this operation already applied, the outcome is `accepted`
     with `reconciled: true`, and nothing mutates.
   - The baseline is checked only when there is no such evidence.

   Checking the baseline first would turn a lost acknowledgement into a false conflict,
   because the operation's own write is what changed the document.
2. **Reconciliation is a read.** It never runs the update, not even a "no-op" update,
   because that path writes to the document.
3. **Evidence is the last write.** The operation ID is stamped after every mutation
   phase. An operation that began mutating (marked before its first write) but has no
   completion evidence is `recovery_required`.
4. **Without evidence, a changed baseline is `baseline_conflict`.** It is reported
   before mutating, never as an overwrite.

`fusion_mutation_precheck()` in `server/cadlink/operations.py` states this order in code.

## Ordering

- Explicit solve requests stay separate. A later request never silently erases an
  earlier one.
- CAD mutations are serialised per document, with exact instance targeting inside it.

## Existing installations

- **The import.** Before schema 12, terminal solve-command outcomes lived in
  `<data dir>/ipc/wglink/solve-commands.json`. Opening the store imports that file into
  `cad_operations` in the same transaction as the schema upgrade:
  - `accepted` stays `accepted`;
  - `refused` becomes `rejected`;
  - the message moves to `outcome_json.message`;
  - the row is marked `legacy = 1`.
- **Nothing is reconstructed.** A legacy row keeps what history recorded and nothing
  more. Its digest, digest version, target and inputs stay NULL, and nothing is rebuilt
  from today's data.
- **Retiring the file.** It is renamed to `solve-commands.json.migrated` only after the
  transaction commits. If an earlier import already left that name, the new copy gets a
  timestamp suffix.
  - An interrupted import rolls back entirely and reruns on the next open.
  - If the rename fails, the rows stay committed. The next open imports nothing new,
    because a row already in the store always wins, and retries the rename.
  - Only the store is ever read, so there is never a second active ledger.
- **Outcomes without a request.** An outcome reported for a solve command whose request
  file WG no longer holds is kept the same way (`legacy = 1`), because its request
  identity is unknown. If WG already holds an unfinished operation under that id, the
  outcome is recorded on it without a digest comparison, because there is no delivered
  request to compare.
- **Redelivering a legacy ID.** A delivery with the same kind recovers the legacy row by
  its ID alone, whatever its digest, and its recorded outcome is replayed. This applies
  to outcome-only rows too. The row is never executed again and never rewritten. A
  delivery of a different kind under that ID is a conflict.
- **The upgrade is one-way.** An older WG refuses a schema-12 `cadlink.db`.

## Solve-command compatibility

`GET /api/cadlink/solve-command` and `POST /api/cadlink/solve-command/outcome` keep
their response shapes. The outcome route records the first terminal outcome, and
repeating the same outcome is idempotent.

A conflicting report is not recorded. That covers a different outcome, and a request
file that names the same command id with a different request. The route answers with
the outcome that stands, or with a refusal of the conflicting request, plus
`"conflict": true`. A client then retires its copy instead of retrying a report that can
never be recorded. The stored operation is left untouched.

Polling applies the same rule before it replays an outcome or hands a command out. A
request file whose id already names a different request, or a different kind of
operation, is answered with a refusal and removed. The operation that holds the id is
neither rewritten nor used as the answer.

**Mixed versions.** An add-in that predates this contract checks the baseline before it
looks for evidence. A lost acknowledgement from such an add-in can therefore still
surface as a false conflict, until the add-in implements the order above.

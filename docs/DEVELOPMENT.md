# Development guide

Status: current contributor and agent orientation, verified 2026-08-13.

## Source-of-truth order

1. Executable code and tests are the behavior authority.
2. Documents under `reference/` state the intended stable boundary.
3. `plans/` contains only work that is still open.
4. `legacy/`, `history/`, and the dated folders in `validation/` are evidence, not task
   instructions. `validation/MEASUREMENT-TEMPLATE.md` is the exception: a blank form to
   copy when validating a build against a solve.

When a reference and code disagree, stop and reconcile them in the same change. Do not
implement an old `BATCH-*-BRIEF.md`: those one-use work orders were removed after the
August rebuild and remain available in Git history.

## Architecture map

- `frontend/src/stores/` owns editor, preferences, autosave, and run-export state.
- `frontend/src/api/` owns HTTP/WebSocket boundaries.
- `frontend/src/viewport/` renders binary preview frames; it does not derive geometry.
- `server/design/` parses, migrates, validates, and serializes design documents.
- `server/cli/` provides headless design and local solve-readiness commands.
- `server/preview/` translates a design into the pinned mesher preview API.
- `server/jobs/` owns durable jobs, snapshot/cursor events, retention, and recovery.
- `server/solver/` builds solver requests and maps every backend to one result contract.
- `server/exports/` owns authoritative geometry and CAD-link bundle exports.
- `server/cadlink/` owns CAD identity, registries, return ingestion, and Onshape access.
- `shared/` contains the cross-language binary-frame contract and fixtures.
- `pins.json` fixes the HornLab mesher, solver, plotting, and simulation repositories.

The authoritative flow is:

```text
design text/UI -> typed design -> HornLab mesher -> preview or solver artifact
                                     |                    |
                                     +-> CAD/mesh export  +-> backend -> result contract
```

## Names and legacy evidence

The product and GitHub repository are `Waveguide Generator` / `waveguide-generator`.
`WG2_*`, `v2-snapshot`, the historical SPA asset name, and the macOS bundle identifier
are compatibility identifiers and must not be changed as part of cosmetic renaming.
The retired application is preserved on `origin/v1`; use immutable Git objects from
that branch when legacy behavior must be rechecked. A removed sibling checkout is not
a valid runtime dependency.

## Verification

Run checks in proportion to the change:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check server scripts shared launch launchers
.venv/bin/python -m pytest server/tests scripts/tests -q
node --test shared/js/frame.test.mjs
cd frontend && npm test && npm run build
```

The lint line is first because it is the cheapest and the easiest to forget: it
is the same command the **Generated-file drift** job runs, and that job has
turned `main` red for a single unused import. `ruff` is in
`server/requirements-dev.txt` for exactly this reason. The other two checks that
job runs are worth the same habit before a release:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/gen_requirements.py --check
.venv/bin/python scripts/bump_version.py --check
```

Geometry, solver, platform, or release work may also require the pinned sibling suites,
constellation checks, a real browser, or owned qualification hardware. Hosted CI never
runs real Metal or BEMPP solves.

## Documentation changes

Every new document must state its audience or status, and current plans must list only
unfinished work. Dated measurements include the machine and tested state. Moving a
contract requires updating any test or docstring that reads it directly.
